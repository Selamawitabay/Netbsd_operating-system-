# Netbsd_operating-system-
# installation 
To install NetBSD, I used VirtualBox to create a virtual machine. I selected the NetBSD ISO file and started the virtual setup. I followed the installation steps: choosing the language, keyboard layout, and disk to install on. I used default partition sizes and automatic file system settings to make it easier. Then, I completed the setup by setting a root password and timezone. After the installation finished, I removed the ISO and rebooted into the NetBSD system. It was my first time installing this OS, and it helped me learn how system installation works practically.

# system call 
A system call is how a program asks the operating system to do something for it, like reading a file, writing data, or using the internet. It acts as a bridge between user programs and the hardware. In NetBSD, like in other UNIX-like systems, system calls are very important because they control basic functions such as opening files, creating processes, and managing memory. Learning about system calls helped me understand how programs actually interact with the OS, and it gave me a clearer view of how the system works behind the scenes.
